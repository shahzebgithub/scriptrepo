This script is for discovery scanning through Nmap. It ask you file name for saving Nmap output, then it'll filter only the hosts that're up and will require you a filename again for saving only filtered Nmap output that contains only Host IP that are up!



#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter filename to save Nmap output:"
read FNvar
touch $FNvar
echo " "
echo "Enter subnet to Scan: "
read IPvar
nmap -sn -oG $FNvar $IPvar
echo " "
echo "Enter a new filename to save output :"
read FNvar1
cat $FNvar | grep "Host" | cut -d ' ' -f 2 > $FNvar1
echo "Your scanned output is saved into the file" $FNvar1
rm $FNvar
